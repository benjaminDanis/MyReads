# MyReads

### Overview

MyReads is an application built with React.js, bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Users can update a Book Case containing all the books they are currently reading, want to read, and have already read. Each book will appear on the corresponding shelf according to it's status. Users can also add books to their Book Case from a select [list of terms](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md) on a separate search page. Updates from their Book Case will appear real-time on the search page, and vice versa. This project is the conclusion of the React Fundamentals course from Udacity's React Nanodegree Program.
